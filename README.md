Performance of JsonPowerDB:The use of jsonpowerdb makes application development fast and this is fast <br>         as we use Json as we can directly use it with front end.

Ease of use of jpdb-commons.js: We use some functions from jpdb-common.Js which makes development even <br>        easy as we can store and get our date using few lines and the functions are also in limited number.

Jsonpowerdb is Native Server Side NoSQL, suitable for high performance real-time data processing.<br>
